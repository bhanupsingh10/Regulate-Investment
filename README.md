# Regulate-Investment
The solution approach in Python language of the Challenge for the Backend Developer at the Provakil.

## Problem Statement
There is a Venture Capital firm called Cueball Capital. Having lost a lot of money in the last few
years, they have decided to regulate their investment by following a strict budget. Their budget
consists of several rules which are applicable on time period or type of investment or both.
Given two CSV files, one consisting of rules for Cueball Capital's budget and another
consisting of investment opportunities. Any investment that does not violate the budget
should be assumed to be made, so that the relevant budget is then reduced by that amount.
Finally, the program should output a list of investment opportunities (their IDs, each one on a
separate line) which violate the budget.
